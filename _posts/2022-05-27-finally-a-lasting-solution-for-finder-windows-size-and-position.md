I've been struggling with Finder windows since forever. Try googling the following keywords "reddit finder windows size". You'll get a huge number of hits stretching over years of Reddit memory.

A couple of days ago, I stumbled on [**FinderFix**](https://synappser.github.io/apps/finderfix/) while browsing new GitHub repositories and despite it being in public beta, tried it out of despair.

Man, was I pleasantly surprised! It's been since running smoothly on my system and does much more than just resizing and repositioning those recalcitrant Finder windows. I'll let you discover its other features ;)

I enthusiastically recommended it here. I'm sharing with you the reaction of [u/MrVegetableMan](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/uh8jzu/whenever_i_connect_my_external_drive_the_sidebar/ia3s66l/?context=3):
> OH MY GOD! Bro you’re a god sent. Thanks man I love this app. Also that cmd + X for cut/paste. Oof so good!

Here's a direct download link: [https://synappser.github.io/downloads/](https://synappser.github.io/downloads/).

I do recommend however to first take a look at the funny video explaining the "why" of Finder's behaviour on [https://synappser.github.io/apps/finderfix/](https://synappser.github.io/apps/finderfix/) (top right of the page).
