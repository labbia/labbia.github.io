title: Professional Procrastinator and GTD - Which Apps Are Really Helping You? 
layout: post
---

I have read that the human brain is wired for procrastination. Here's my usual pattern which I guess is pretty common: I have some long-due task that I keep pushing back until it starts haunting me. As I'm still not ready to tackle it, I start looking for some new toy that would sweeten the pill. 

I've thus tested every *GTD* application under the sun but keep coming back to [**TaskPaper**](https://www.taskpaper.com/) and [**Things**](https://culturedcode.com/things/), mixing the two sometimes, to really end up getting something done.

In the past, I also tried [**Merlin Project**](https://www.projectwizards.net/en) despite my revulsion for Gantt charts. I'm giving it a new go this week and I find their holistic approach very refreshing. To sum it up, you start with a mind map view, switching to a Gantt chart or kanban view with simple keyboard shortcuts without losing hold of your tasks organisation. This gives you a better global vision of your goals and progress.

If task management is a topic that may concern you, read their fictional booklet titled [The Relocation: A demo project in Merlin Project](https://www.projectwizards.net/documentation/merlin-project/pm-with-merlinproject/en/index.html) ([PDF version](https://www.projectwizards.net/documentation/merlin-project/pm-with-merlinproject/en/Relocation-Project.en.pdf)).

What about you? Which tools work best for you and why? 

Please share your thoughts and your own approach.
