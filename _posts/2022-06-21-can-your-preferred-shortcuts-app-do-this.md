title: Can Your Preferred Shortcuts-App Do This?
layout: post

Most browser extensions can read sensitive information from web pages, including passwords, credit cards and whatnot. So I try and disable them before entering sensitive information.

A shortcut that comes in handy is **⇧⌘/** because it works in practically every application and very quickly since it is built into macOS.

One could obviously add a keyboard shortcut for this menu item in the App Shortcuts preferences pane but you would eventually run out of available shortcuts.

Do you know of any better alternative that would also work with Dockless applications?

P.S. [**Paletro**](https://appmakes.io/paletro)  by appmakes.io, the makers of Typora, works similarly by pressing **⇧⌘P** but also does not handle Dockless applications.
