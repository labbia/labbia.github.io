title: Do You Know of a macOS Mail Client With a Total Count Badge in the Menubar?
layout: post

I already know [**AirMail**](https://airmailapp.com/) can do this and Apple's Mail has an extension for that but I am looking for an alternative. It should support *IMAP* with *TLS 1.2* and run on *macOS Big Sur* and *Monterey* as a requirement. I do mean a menubar badge-icon and not a Dock icon.

Thank you
